 *
 * Revision History:
 * Date Name Description
 * ------  --------- -------------------------------------------------
 * 03/2013 G. Lucas  Created as part of IncrementalTIN
 * 08/2013 G. Lucas  Replaced stack-based edge flipping algorithm with
 *                    Bowyer-Watson approach that doesn't disturb TIN.
 * 05/2014 G. Lucas  Broken into separate class
 * 08/2015 G. Lucas  Refactored for QuadEdge class
 * 09/2015 G. Lucas  Added BarycenterCoordinateDeviation concept as a way
 *                     to double-check correctness of implementation and
 *                     adjusted calculation to map vertex coordinates so that
 *                     the query point is at the origin.
 * 01/2016 G. Lucas  Added calculation for surface normal
 * 11/2016 G. Lucas  Added support for constrained Delaunay
 * 12/2020 G. Lucas  Correction for misbehavior near edges of problematic
 *                     meshes. Removed ineffective surface normal calculation.
 *                     Modified barycentric coordinates to conform to Sibson's
 *                     definition and properly support transition across
 *                     neighboring point sets.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   As a reminder, this class must not perform direct comparison of
 * edges because it is used not just for the direct (QuadEdge) implementation
 * of edges, but also for the VirtualEdge implementation.  Therefore,
 * comparisons must be conducted by invoking the equals() method.

   * Given a reference point enclosed by a polygon defining its

   * giving the computed weighting factors for the vertices that comprise
   * the polygon. Sibson coordinates are often represented using the
   * Greek letter lambda.  The coordinate are normalized so that their sum
   * is 1.0.
   * <p>
   * This method works only if the input polygon represents the set of
   * natural neighbors of the reference point given in counterclockwise
   * order. This polygon will be a simple, non-self-intersecting loop.
   * Other polygons will not necessarily produce correct results.
   * <p>
   * <b>Using Sibson's coordinates as a self-test for this implementation</b>
   * <p>
   * Sibson's coordinates are generalized Barycentric coordinates
   * (Bobach, 2009, pg. 7). Consequently,
   * the weighting factors computed using this method should be able to
   * compute the Cartesian coordinates of the reference point to a high
   * degree of accuracy (within the limits of floating-point precision).
   * Thus, the results of this calculation can be used as a <i>figure of merit</i>
   * for any interpolation operation using Sibson coordinates. By backward
   * computing the (x,y) coordinates of the reference point from the
   * (x,y) coordinates of the natural neighbors and their weights,
   * and then comparing the result against the original, this method
   * derives a value that Tinfour calls the "Barycentric deviation".
   * This deviation is stored internally to instances of this class and
   * may be fetched after a calculation by calling the
   * getBarycentricDeviation() method. If the interpolation logic works well,
   * the deviation would be zero or close to zero, resulting a favorable
   * figure of merit.
   * <p>
   * If the point is not inside the polygon or if
   * the polygon is not a proper set of natural neighbors, the results are undefined
   * and the method may return a null array or a meaningless result.
   * If the point is on the perimeter of the polygon, this method will
   * return a null array.
   * <p>
   * For a rigorous discussion of the equivalence of Sibson's local
   * coordinates and Barycentric coordinates, see
