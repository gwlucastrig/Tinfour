/**
 * Defines the primary methods used by an incremental TIN
 * implementation.
 * <h1>Implementations</h1>
 * Currently, the Tinfour software library includes two implementations
 * of this interface: IncrementalTin in the package org.tinfour.standard,
 * and SemiVirtualIncrementalTin in the package org.tinfour.semivirtual.
 * The two classes produce nearly identical output data. The standard
 * IncrementalTin implementation is faster and simpler than its counterpart,
 * but the semi-virtual implementation reduces memory use by a factor
 * of two.  Under Java, IncrementalTin requires approximately 244 bytes per
 * vertex while the semi-virtual form requires about 120.
 * <p>
 * The main difference between the two implementations is that standard
 * incremental-TIN implementation represents each edge as an explicitly
 * constructed pair of objects (using the QuadEdge class) while the semi-virtual
 * implementation stores the raw data for vertices in memory and constructs
 * edge objects on-the-fly (using the SemiVirtualEdge class).
 * The semi-virtual approach has some processing overhead in that each
 * time an edge is required, it must be constructed and then allowed to
 * go out-of-scope. This approach results in about a 30 percent reduction
 * in the speed at which vertices can be added to the TIN. But by relying on
 * short-persistence edge objects, the semi-virtual class reduces the
 * number of objects kept in memory and the overall memory use.
 * The standard implementation classes uses about 7.005 objects per vertex
 * (including vertices, edges, and collections for management), while the
 * semi-virtual implementation uses about persistent 1.012 objects per vertex.
 * <h2>Usage Notes</h2>
 * <h3>Purpose of this Interface</h3>
 * The intended purpose of this interface is to allow application
 * code to use the two classes interchangeably. Applications may select
 * which implementation is constructed at run-time based on the size
 * of their input data sets.
 * <h3>Multi-Threading and Concurrency</h3>
 * The process of creating a Delaunay Triangulation (TIN) using an
 * incremental-insertion technique is inherently serial. Therefore, application
 * code that creates a TIN should not attempt to access the "add" methods
 * for this interface in parallel threads.  However, this API is designed so
 * that once a TIN is complete, it can be accessed by multiple threads
 * on a read-only basis.
 * Multi-threaded access is particularly useful when performing
 * surface-interpolation operations to construct raster (grid) representations
 * of data.
 * <h3>Constraints and constrained edges</h3>
 * Normally, Tinfour is free to choose the geometry of the edges in a triangular
 * mesh based on the Delaunay criterion. But some applications require that
 * certain edges be preserved as specified. Therefore, Tinfour supports
 * the specification of constraint objects to create a Constrained Delaunay
 * Triangulations (CDT). Background information on the CDT is provided at
 * the Tinfour project web article
 * <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/DelaunayIntroCDT/index.html">
 * What is the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation and why would you care?</a>.

   * Inserts a list of vertices into the collection of vertices managed by the

   * the TIN.
   * <h1>Performance Consideration Related to List</h1>
   *
   * In the bootstrap phase, three points are chosen at random from the vertex
   * list to create the initial triangle for insertion. In the event that the
   * three points are not a suitable choice (as when they are collinear or
   * nearly collinear), the process will be repeated until a valid initial
   * triangle is selected. Thus, there is a small performance advantage in
   * supplying the vertices using a list that can be accessed efficiently in a
   * random order (see the discussion of the Java API for the List and
   * java.util.RandomAccess interfaces). Once the initial triangle is
   * established, the list will be traversed sequentially to build the TIN and
   * random access considerations will no longer apply.
   *
   * <h1>Performance Consideration Related to Location of Vertices</h1>
   *
   * The performance of the insertion process is sensitive to the
   * relative location of vertices.  An input data set based on
   * <strong>purely random</strong> vertex positions represents one of the
   * worst-case input sets in terms of processing time.
   * <p>
   * Ordinarily, the most computationally expensive operation for inserting
   * a vertex into the Delaunay triangulation is locating the triangle
   * that contains its coordinates. But Tinfour implements logic to
   * expedite this search operation by taking advantage of a characteristic
   * that occurs in many data sets:  the location of one vertex in a sequence
   * is usually close to the location of the vertex that preceded it.
   * By starting each search at the position in the triangulation where a vertex
   * was most recently inserted, the time-to-search can be reduced dramatically.
   * Unfortunately, in vertices generated by a random process, this assumption
   * of sequential proximity (i.e. "spatial autocorrelation") is not true.
   * <p>
   * To assist in the case of random or poorly correlated vertex geometries,
   * application can take advantage of the HilbertSort class which is supplied
   * as part of the Core Tinfour module. In the example shown below, the
   * use of the HilbertSort yields a <strong>factor of 100</strong>
   * improvement in the time to perform the .add() method.
   * <pre>
   *      int nVertices = 1_000_000;
   *      List&lt;Vertex&gt; vertices = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

   *        double x = Math.random() * 1000;
   *        double y = Math.random() * 1000;
   *        vertices.add(new Vertex(x, y, 0));

   *      HilbertSort hs = new HilbertSort();

  /**
   * Adds constraints to the TIN.
   * <p>
   * <strong>Using Constraints</strong>
   * <p>
   * There are a number of important restrictions to the use of constraints.
   * Constraints must only be added to the TIN once, preferably after non-constraint
   * vertices have already been added. Furthermore, the addConstraint method can only
   * be called once. Logic is implemented as a safety measure to ensure that
   * these restrictions are not accidentally violated.
   * <p>
   * There are also important restrictions on the geometry of constraints.
   * Most importantly, constraints must never intersect each other except
   * at the endpoints of the segments that define them (i.e. segments
   * in constraints must never cross each other). Due to the high cost of
   * processing required to check that this restriction is observed,
   * it is not directly enforced by the Tinfour implementations.
   * <p>
   * Finally, there is a limit to the number of constraint objects that
   * can be added to the incremental TIN. At this time, the total number
   * of constraint objects is limited to 8190 (2^13-2). A constraint object
   * may contain multiple edges, so the total number of edges is only limited
   * by available memory and processing time. The reason for this restriction
   * is that Tinfour attempts to conserve the amount of memory dedicated to
   * edges and allows only a single 32-bit integer to store constraint references
   * and state data.
   * <p>
   * <strong>Restoring Conformity</strong>
   * <p>
   * When constraints are added to a Delaunay triangulation, they often
   * violate the Delaunay criterion and result in a non-conforming
   * mesh. The addConstraint method can optionally restore conformity
   * by inserting synthetic points into the the constraint edges.
   * The cost of this process is additional processing time and
   * an increase in the number of points in the TIN.
   * <p>
   * When points are synthesized, it is necessary to interpolate
   * a value for the z-coordinate. At this time, the specific interpolation
   * process is undefined. The current Tinfour implementations
   * use linear interpolation between constraint points. While no
   * viable alternative approach is currently under consideration, the
