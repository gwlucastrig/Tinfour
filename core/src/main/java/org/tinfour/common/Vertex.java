 * Revision History:
 * Date     Name        Description
 * ------   ---------   -------------------------------------------------
 * 02/2014  G. Lucas    Created
 * 03/2014  G. Lucas    Moved z from public to protected and added getZ()
 *                       methods as preferred means of access.  This is needed
 *                       to support the merger class which may return a computed
 *                       value for the vertex based on a resolution method
 * 05/2014  G. Lucas    Added the mark element as a way of simplifying the
 *                        getVertices() method in TIN.  Also available for other
 *                        uses.
 * 12/2014  G. Lucas    Modified to implement ISamplePoint interface
 * 08/2015  G. Lucas    To reduce memory use, removed mark and reference elements,
 *                        reduced z to a float.
 * 08/2018  G. Lucas    Redefined element reserved2 to become colorIndex
 *                        in support of graph-coloring algorithms.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * The selection of elements in this class was chosen to reduce the amount
 * of memory used by the class.  In general, I caution anyone modifying this
 * class to be mindful of the effect of new elements on overall size.
 * The data type for the x and y coordinates is double while the coordinate
 * for z is float. This choice reflects the pedigree of this code and the
 * fact that it was originally intended for Geographic Information System (GIS)
 * implementations.  In GIS systems, it is common to represent the horizontal
 * coordinates of a point in meters.  Since the circumference of the Earth
 * is about 40 million meters, it is common to see cases where two
 * points might have coordinates that are only be one meter apart,
 * but due to the global reference system used to represent them they have
 * values close to 10's of millions.  In such a case, the 4-byte float format
 * does not provide enough precision to represent the points, so the
 * eight-byte Java double must be used.  However, the range of z coordinates
 * in GIS systems tends to be much smaller, permitting a the use of Java
 * floats as a way of conserving memory space.
 *
 * Recall that the size of a object instance must be a multiple of 8.
 * On a 32 bit JVM and many 64 bit JVM's, the design of this class
 * results  in the following layout:
 *    Java overhead:                      8 bytes  (JVM dependent)
 *    Class reference (used by Java)      4 bytes
 *    int index                           4 bytes
 *    double x                            8 bytes
 *    double y                            8 bytes
 *    float  z                            4 bytes
 *    byte   status                       1 byte
 *    byte   auxiliaryIndex               1 byte
 *    padding (reserved by Java)          2 bytes (not committed at this time)
 *    --------------------------        ---------
 *    Total                              40 bytes
 *
 *  Because of byte alignment, the one-byte status element does not
 *  actually change the overall size of the Vertex objects.
 *  And, in fact, there is room to add one or more data elements totaling
 *  to 3 bytes or less without increasing the memory use for
 *  instances of this class. This use can be accomplished by applications
 *  that use Tinfour by creating derived classes from this class.
 *  However, testing shows that, to make this approach work, some implementations
 *  of Java require that the elements to exploit the padding must be declared
 *  in the base class.  So the following elements are declared with
 *  protected scope and left for the use of derived classed as required
 *  by applications that use Tinfour:
 *     reserved0
 *     reserved1
 *     reserved2
