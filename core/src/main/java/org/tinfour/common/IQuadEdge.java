 * Notes:
 * Special considerations for setForward() and setReverse()
 *   It is not an oversight that this interface does not specify
 * setForward() and setReverse() methods. Early on, I performed a
 * test implementation in which these methods were included in the
 * interface.  While this approach permitted a lot of code to be shared by
 * the standard and virtual TIN implementations, the overhead related to
 * Java type casting (downcasting) resulted in a surprising 27 percent
 * degradation in performance (as measured using the TwinBuildTest).

/**
 * Defines methods for accessing the data in a quad-edge
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * In general, get operations can be performed without
 * any degradation of performance.  However, set operations on quad-edges
 * often require down casting (narrow casting) of object references.
 * In ordinary applications, the performance cost of down casting is small.
 * But for TIN applications require very large data sets with repeated
 * modifications to the edge structure of the TIN, this cost can degrade
 * processing rates by as much as 25 percent. Thus this interface avoids
 * specifying any methods that set edge relationships (connections).

 * See the definition of IConstraint for a discussion of constrained regions.

   * may terminate on the "ghost vertex" which is used by Tinfour to
   * complete the triangulation.  The ghost vertex is represented by
   * a null reference.  So applications performing a pinwheel on an
   * arbitrary edge should include logic to handle a null return from the
