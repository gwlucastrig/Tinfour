 *
 * Collecting triangles from constrained regions ------------------
 *  The triangle collector for a constrained region uses a mesh-traversal
 * operation where it traverses from edge to edge, identifying triangles and
 * calling the accept() method from a Java consumer.  In general, this
 * process is straightforward, though there is one special case.
 *  Recall that in Tinfour, the interior to a constrained region is always to
 * the left of an edge.  Thus, a polygon enclosing a region would be given
 * in counterclockwise order.  Conversely, if a polygon were given in
 * clockwise order such that the area it enclosed was always to the right
 * of the edges, the polygon would define a "hole" in the constrained
 * region. The region it enclosed would not belong to the constrained region.
 *   Now imaging a case where a constrained region is defined by a single
 * clockwise polygon somewhere within the overall domain of the Delaunay
 * Triangulation. The "constrained region" that it establishes is somewhat
 * counterintuitively defined as being outside the polygon and extendending
 * to the perimeter of the overall triangulation.
 *   In this case, if we attempt to use traversal, some of the triangles
 * we collect will actually be the "ghost" triangles that define the
 * exterior to the triangulation. Ghost triangles are those that include
 * the so-called "ghost" vertex.  Tinfour manages the ghost vertex using
 * a null vertex.  Thus it would be possible to collect triangles which
 * contain null vertices.   In order to avoid passing null vertices to
 * the accept() method, Tinfour must screen for this condition.
