Tinfour Release 2.1.9  November 2025 --------------------------

Release 2.1.9 introduces two major new features to the Tinfour API:
   1.  Delaunay Refinement (see issue 121)
   2.  AlphaShapes (see issue 117)

Other changes or new features in the API include
   1.  Introduction of the IIncrementalTin.edgeAndDual() iterator (see issue 132)
   2.  Change to order of edges produced by the IQuadEdge.pinwheel() iterator (see issue 133)
 
Additionally, we have addressed a small number of bugs, particularly those related
to the assignment of constraints to edges when adding vertices to an existing
Incremental TIN instance that already includes constraint objects.
We also cleaned up numerous Javadoc issues.

The Tinfour software project gratefully acknowledges the contribution
of Mr. Michael Carleton who created the RuppertRefiner class.
The new class implements Delaunay refinement, a technique that has
been on the Tinfour "wishlist" for quite a long time.
