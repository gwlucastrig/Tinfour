# A Properties File Template for the Simple Volumetric Model (SVM)
#
#  The text below gives an example of the specifications for
#  a typical properties file that defines the inputs for an SVM model run.
#  The settings shown here are based on those for the Alan Henry Reservoir
#  data published by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB).
#  Please adjust the settings according to the requirements of your own data sources.
#
#  Note: SVM is currently in development and some of these settings 
#        may be subject to change as the model matures.
#

# SVM was developed in the US.  By default, it file output follows the numeric
# formatting conventions specified by the Locale parameters available from the
# Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For example, if the environment is configured to use
# non-English conventions, SVM will use those.  If desired, you may explicitly set
# the Java Locale for the current application instance by using the settings below.

#  Notes -----------------------------------------
#  Bathymetry Model --------------------------------------
#
#      bathymetry model:  [Elevation, Depth]
#
#  The bathymetry model tells SVM how to interpret the 
#  bathymetry data obtained from the samples. This setting is mandatory.
#  At this time, SVM recognizes three different approaches to sounding data:
#
#     Elevation: The vertical coordinates from the source data 
#                represent elevations referenced to the vertical datum used
#                by the source data. Typically, these are values given
#                as positive elevations in Mean Sea Level (MSL)
#                which decrease as the water gets deeper.
#
#     Depth:     The vertical coordinates form the source data represent
#                depth measured as positive values increasing as the
#                water gets deeper with a zero value at the surface.
#
#     DepthNegative:  The vertical coordinates form the source data represent
#                depth measured as negative values decreasing as the
#                water gets deeper with a zero value at the surface.
#
#
#  Folder Settings ---------------------------------------
#  The input and output folder settings provide optional
#  specifications for folders to be used for input and output data.
#  The purpose of these settings is to provide a short-cut for
#  specifying file names.  If they are provided, SVM will seek
#  the indicated input files in the inputFolder and will store
#  the indicated output files (report and table) to the outputFolder.
#
#  Note that if any of the input or output file settings are given
#  as absolute paths, the folder specifications will not be applied to them.
#
#  Policy regarding missing folders ---------------
#  If either the input or output folder is missing, the application will
#  print an error to standard output and terminate.  In particular,
#  note that the application will NOT create a missing folder.
#  This approach is intended to avoid the output from a model
#  run from being written due to an unexpected location due
#  to a mistake in a properties specification.  
#    However, when the output paths for analysis products
#  (contours, rasters, and text reports) include sub-folders
#  the sub-folders will be automatically created as needed.
#
#
#  Input File Settings ----------------------------------------
#  The input source for SVM is usually Shapefiles, though the
#  point-based "samples" and "supplement" settings may be specified
#  for tab-delimited text and comma-separated-value (CSV) files.
#  Bathymetric lidar (las, laz) files are also supported.
#  For Shapefiles, the input may specify the field from the
#  associated DBF file to be used as an elevation source.  The field
#  name is given by a "pipe" character folloed by the name of the field.
#  The following settings are supported:
#
#      samples     the primary set of bathymetry (bottom elevation) data points
#      supplement  the secondary set of bathymetry data points
#      bounds      the bounding polygons (shoreline) for the body of water
#
#  Multiple sets of samples and supplements may be specified using numeric
#  appendices.  For example supplement01, supplement02, etc.
#  In the current implementation, SVM does not treat samples or supplements
#  differently. In future implementations, it is planned to perform spatial analysis
#  on samples to determine information about the survey pattern.  Thus 
#  the "samples" setting should be reserved for the primary bathymetry data.
#
#  Specifying the DBF field or fixed value for vertical coordinates
#  By default, the vertical coordinates for the samples, supplement, and bounds
#  features are extracted from the z coordinates given in the Shapefile.
#  However, many Shapefiles do not provide z coordinates.  In such cases,
#  the preferred approach is to extract vertical coordinates from
#  the associated DBF file.  Alternately, some applications may prefer
#  to override the Shapefile/DBF settings entirely by specifying a fixed value.
#  The samples, supplement, and bounds specifications allow you to include
#  additional parameters by including a vertical "pipe" character followed
#  by metadata.  
#    optional field 1   --  specifies the name of an attribute from the associated
#                            DBF file from which to extract vertical coordinates,
#                            or a numeric value giving a fixed value for vertical
#                            coordinates
#       
#   optional field 2    --  specifies a scale and offset value for converting 
#                            the vertical coordinates.  For example, if the two
#                            parameters -1 and 0 are provided the data will be
#                            multiplied by the scale factor -1 and then adjusted 
#                            by adding the offset of zero.
#
#    For example, in a case where neither the Shapefile nor the DBF provided
#    a valid set of vertical coordinates for a reservoir boundary, an application
#    could use a setting in the following form:
#         bounds = boundary_polygon.shp  |  2220
#
#    In a case where a shapefile gave depth values rather than bottom elevation,
#    depths could be converted to elevations (to support the Elevation bathymetry model)
#    as follows:
#         bounds  = boundary_polygon.shp | 2220
#         samples = depth_points.shp     |  depth  |  -1 2220
#    This setting would cause depth values to be subtracted from the offset 2220.
#
#  When input data is from a text file organized by columns using a delimiter character
#  such as a comma or tab, it is common for the first row in the file to give names to
#  the columns (i.e. "column headers").  In such cases, the optional source specification fields
#  can be used to specify which columns are to be used as data sources.  The specification
#  requires that the field include three header names separated by commas or white space:
#       samples = depth_text.csv |   x, y, elevation
#       samples = depth_text.tab |   easting	northing	elevation 
#
#  When input data is from a lidar source, the input samples may be filtered
#  by classification or first/last return.  Filter specifications are given in
#  the form of a comma-separated list of accepted elements. If no filter
#  specification is provided, all samples are accepted. Examples include the following:
#
#        samples = bathy_lidar.las               accept all samples
#        samples = bathy_lidar.las | first       accept first returns only
#        samples = bathy_lidar.las | 2           samples with classification 2 (ground points)
#        samples = bathy_lidar.las | first, 2, 3, 10-12
#                                                accept first returns, 
#                                                and classifications 2, 3 and 10 through 12

#  Coordinate Systems for Input Data
#  To obtain correct results, it is critical that the horizontal and vertical
#  coordinate systems for the input data be consistent.  The horizontal 
#  coordinate should be given in a projected coordinate system with the 
#  same metric as the lake bottom elevation data.
#
#  Output File Settings -------------------------------------------
#  Normally, the output text for SVM is directed to the console (standard output).
#  However, text can be directed to files using the following options
#
#      report    a file to receive diagnostic and summary information
#                for each run of the model
#
#      table     a file to receive the comma-separated value output
#                of a table giving volume and surface area as a function
#                of water level
#  
#      tableInterval  specifies the interval between water level values for
#                     the analysis. The default interval is 1.0 units.
#
#
#  Units of Distance, Area, and Volume  ----------------------------------
#  The units of distance, area, and volume settings allow you to configure the
#  units of measure for the various output values.  The defaults are metric
#  values given as:
#         unitOfDistance = m    |  1.0
#         unitOfArea     = m^2  |  1.0
#         unitOfVolume   = m^3  |  1.0
#  The conversion factors map the units of measure for the input data and
#  computed results to values that may be more convenient for display.
#  If non-zero conversion factors are specified, the computed results 
#  will be DIVIDED by the conversion factor.  Thus if your input values
#  were in meters, and you wished to display data in kilometers and hectares, 
#  the following could be used (1 hectare is 10000 square kilometers)
#         unitOfDistance = km            |  1000.0
#         unitOfArea     = hectare       |  10000.0
#         unitOfVolume   = hectare-meter |  10000.0
#  Alternately, if the source data was given in feet, the following
#  specifications could be used (am acre is equivalent to 43560 square feet)
#         unitOfDistance = ft 
#         unitOfArea     = acres    | 43560
#         unitOfVolume   = acre-ft  | 43560
#
#
#
#  Shoreline Reference Elevation --------------------------------------
#    The shoreline reference elevation allows you to specify the elevation
#  to be used as a basis for computing the volume and surface area
#  for the body of water when it is at full capacity.  For reservoirs,
#  this value is usually the "conservation pool elevation".  If this value
#  is not specified, the elevation of the bounds features will be used.
#  This value should never be larger than the elevation of the bounding
#  polygons.
#
#  Flat-triangle remediation ------------------------------------------
#    The setting to activate flat-triangle remediation is a simple boolean
#  value. By default, remediation is not activated.
#  remediateFlatTriangles = true
#
#
#  Parameters for Raster File Processing ----------------------------------
#      rasterFileName        = SVM_AlanHenryRaster
#      rasterCellSize        = 2.0
#      rasterImageFileName   = SVM_AlanHenryRaster.png
#      rasterGeoTiffFileName = raster/SvmAlanHenry2ft.tiff
#      rasterGeoTiffProjectionCode = 2276
#      rasterGeoTiffNoDataCode      = -9999
#      rasterGeoTiffDataCompression = false
#
#
#  If configured to do so, the SVM utility will interpolate values 
#  for a raster (grid) representation of the data and write it to a
#  file in the Esri, Inc.  FLT (binary) format or GeoTIFF format.   This option 
#  allows analysis products from SVM to be imported into standard
#  GIS tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS. 
#
#  The GeoTIFF projection code is intended as a stop-gap measure.
#  At this time, SVM cannot obtain projection parameters from the
#  shapefile .prj file. The projection code allows a specification
#  to provide an EPSG projection code for the GeoTIFF metadata.
#  In addition to reducing output side, the optional data compression
#  is useful for conserving memory within the SVM runtime environment.
#  However, some software modules, such as Whitebox, may not properly
#  support the floating-point predictor used by TIFF files for data compression.
#  The no-data code is used to populate the no-data element in the TIFF output.
#
